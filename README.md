# Transit Tangent

This repo is for all the transit nerds who want a better system in their city. 

- Show the Good
- Show the Bad 
- Show the Ugly

This is to be a platform for everyone to engage in helping the city understand the downfalls of the transit system.

But not only do we want to show these, we want to help improve with what we have (think staying in budget).

## Starting Principles 

This project aims to be realistic. With most cities, both the population and the budget simply cannont sustain a full light rail system - let alone a heavy rail system. In some cases, these rail systems exist already.. but generally these systems service suburban communities and attempt to acheive a mass migration of residents from one city - or area - to the next. 

The attempt here is to demonstrate the downfall of INTRA-city travel. 

To Simplify --> 

Intra-city = "I want to go down the street"

Inter-city = "I want to go to the next town over"

This Project will focus on intra-city transit! 

## Bus Routes

Some simple principles will guide the direction of the project:

1. One, mostly cardinal/straight, direction. 
2. No more than 6 Miles long in one direction; minimal redundant lines. 
3. Terminate, originate, and/or intersect other major transportation routes — not to be confused with high pedestrian indoor facilities (aka malls)
4. Clear and obvious signage for stop.
5. Stop after light controlled intersections.
6. Frequency — 5 mins ideal; 10 min mandatory. One bus per every half mile. 



### Cardinality 

Much like the interstate system, a clear and obvious direction is helpful to users. If routes are kept cardinal and mostly straight (i.e. North,South,East,West), users can easily navigate without use of phones or maps. Futhermore, with such a simple system, a number system could be constructed that makes understanding easy. 

### Length

Bus Lines that continue on past a certain length can prove redudant and are better suited for transit uses like trains. 

### Intersections

Buses need to be connected together with not just major transit hubs, but also with other buses. 

### Sinage 

This one is pretty obvious. Mark the stop for the bus clearly. 

### Stops

Putting stops in correct places helps a ton. This is obiously flexible per stop/city.

### Frequency

More. Buses. Per. Line.
